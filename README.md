# School App UI

This is the frontend for an app I built
I built this app to help with digital learning

Students use multiple different websites to do there learning
this causes lost files, incomplete work and bad grades

This app uses the Google API to display everything a student needs to know to prevent lost files, incomplete work and bad grades
